# ðŸŒ± Haplotype Diversity & Network Analysis in Python

This project demonstrates **haplotype diversity calculation and visualization** using Python, Biopython, Matplotlib, and NetworkX.  
It is designed for **bioinformatics research** (e.g., ITS, rDNA, plastid sequences) to explore genetic diversity and haplotype structure.

---

## ðŸ”¬ Features
- Calculate **haplotype diversity** index.
- Identify unique haplotypes and their member sequences.
- Plot haplotype frequency distribution (pie chart).
- Build and visualize a **haplotype network** using Hamming distance.
- Export results and plots with **publication-ready quality** (600 DPI).

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/haplotype-diversity-analysis.git
cd haplotype-diversity-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
